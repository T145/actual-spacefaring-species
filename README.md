# Actual Spacefaring Species & Civilizations

üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Aims to add and update Stellaris content related to species!

The primary goal of this mod is to stay as aligned to vanilla content and its style as possible,
so there won't be any hyper-realistic AI images or static clipart.

If there are any mods you'd like to see updated and included, feel free to make an issue with a link to the content!
